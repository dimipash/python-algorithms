# Digital Image Processing (DIP)

A comprehensive guide to digital image processing techniques, applications, and modern developments.

## Core Techniques

### Image Enhancement
- **Contrast Adjustment**: Improves visibility by enhancing differences between light and dark areas
- **Histogram Equalization**: Distributes intensity values evenly for better global contrast
- **Noise Reduction**: Removes unwanted variations using methods like median filtering and Gaussian smoothing

### Image Restoration
- **Deblurring**: Restores sharpness using inverse filtering and Wiener filtering
- **Inpainting**: Reconstructs lost or deteriorated parts of images
- **Denoising**: Preserves details while removing noise using wavelet thresholding

### Image Segmentation
- **Thresholding**: Converts images to binary form by selecting intensity values
- **Edge Detection**: Identifies boundaries using Sobel, Canny, and Prewitt operators
- **Region-based Methods**: Divides images based on similar properties
