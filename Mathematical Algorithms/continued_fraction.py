"""
Continued Fraction Calculator

Converts a rational number p/q into its continued fraction representation
[a0; a1, a2, ..., an] where each ai is an integer term in the expansion.
The algorithm uses successive division with remainder.

Time Complexity: O(log min(p,q)) - Euclidean algorithm complexity
Space Complexity: O(log min(p,q)) to store the terms
