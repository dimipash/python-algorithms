"""
Chebyshev Distance Calculator

Calculates the maximum metric (Lâˆž norm) between two points in n-dimensional space.
The Chebyshev distance is defined as: max(|xi - yi|) for all coordinates i.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the dimension of the points
Space Complexity: O(1) as only scalar values are stored
